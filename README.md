# Features

My website consists of 4 sections: Home, About, Projects, and Skills. The home section or hero section includes an image of myself with social icons and an introduction to the website. This section also has a navbar, which consists of the aforementioned sections. Furthermore, the about section talks about myself and who I am as a person. It also covers interests that I am passionate about. In addition, I implemented a section for skills showcasing technologies and languages that I know. These icons have hyperlinks for ease of use for documentation. Additionally, I finally added a projects section showcasing projects that I have done with links to demos/deployed sites and github repositories.Â
